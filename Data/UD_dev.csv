darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,  who bared their brains to heaven under the el and saw mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated  who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating arkansas and blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,  who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,  who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the terror through the wall,  who got busted in their pubic beards returning through laredo with a belt of marijuana for new york.  who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in paradise alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night  with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless balls,  incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of canada & paterson,

picture postcards of atlantic city hall,  suffering eastern sweats and tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of china under junk-withdrawal in newark's bleak furnished room,  who wandered around and around at midnight in the railroad yard wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts,  who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward lonesome farms in grandfather night,  who studied plotinus poe st. john of the cross telepathy and bop kaballa because the cosmos instinctively vibrated at their feet in kansas,  who loned it through the streets of idaho seeking visionary indian angels who were visionary indian angels,  who thought they were only mad when baltimore gleamed in supernatural ecstasy,  who jumped in limousines with the chinaman of oklahoma on the impulse of winter midnight streetlight smalltown rain,  who lounged hungry and lonesome through houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, and followed the brilliant spaniard to converse about america and eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship to africa,  who disappeared into the volcanoes of mexico leaving behind nothing but the shadow of dungarees and the lava and ash of poetry scattered in fireplace chicago,  who reappeared on the west coast investigating the f.b.i. in beards and shorts with big pacifist eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incomprehensible leaflets,

to the three old shrews of fate the one eyed shrew of the heterosexual dollar the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden threads of the craftsman's loom,  who copulated ecstatic and insatiate with a bottle of beer a sweetheart a package of cigarettes a candle and fell off the bed, and continued along the floor and down the hall and ended fainting on the wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness,  who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling in

and shaking with shame, rejected yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm of thought in his naked and endless head,  the madman bum and angel beat in time, unknown, yet putting down here what might be left to say in time come after death,  and rose reincarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in the goldhorn shadow of the band and blew the suffering of america's naked mind for love into

christian,"(i understand that everyone doesnt hate us. this is to those that do.)  we believe that jesus died on the cross to save us from our sins. he didnt have to but he did anyway. (and it is in history, in case you were all wonderin)it is true that some people do things in the ""name of god"" that are horrible and say that god made them do it, that is not true, and that is what gives christians a bad name. those people are not christians, they just want someone to use as a excuse for doing something bad.   you hate us because you say that we think that we are better than you, which is completely 100% untrue. the bible says that we are to consider everyone above us, and be humble (see below). if you have never met a christian like that then you have never met a true follower of christ.   another reason you hate us is that you say we condemn everone who doesnt believe in god, true christians do not do that. there is something that the world needs to understand, there are people who call themselves christains, and then totally dont act like it. and then there are christians who follow god, and his word. the latter do not condemn people becuase who are we to condemn when we are just the same as you?  people who have posted definitions say that we are boring. but fun isnt..., drinkng,smoking,having sex,partying,playing gory games and watching gory movies all the time. isnt is true that after you do that for a while you start to feel empty, bored and like you are wondering around without cause? those things begin to control you, (you who say nothing controls you). and that sounds boring to me. i have a cause, i have a life, and i do not appreciate being cursed for my beliefs. i love god and i am not ashamed to say it nor will i ever be.  if you would like any more info, ask a friend if you can visit thier church, just to see if i am telling the truth. or watch the passion of the christ by mel gibson, everything in that movie is true, that really did happen to jesus. but in real life, it was worse for him.  another thing, if your friends harass you for wanting to go, just think about what kind of friends they are. what kind of friend would want to control you? you say you are going to do what you want to do, and no one can tell you otherwise. we are the same, people tell us otherwise all the time. they harass us, degrade us, hate us, even kill us. but we will never back down, we are part of the army of the unashamed. and no matter what you have done, where you have been, what you have said, you can be part of it too. we will accept you. we do not hate you. we do not condemn you and we do not think we are better than you are. we do not save ourselves by anything we do, god saved us. and he can save you too.  find a good church (which takes some visiting), find a youth group, and get plugged in. you will be amazed about how much you didnt know about us.

bipolar,"a term for someone with bipolar disorder or manic-depressive illness, a mood disorder characterized by periods of depression including:  -persistent sadness -low energy -hopelessness -suicidal thoughts  as well as periods of mania in bipolar i disorder, or hypomania (a less extreme form) in bipolar ii disorder. symptoms of hypomania include:  -grandiose ideas -racing thoughts -reckless overindulgence -high energy/decreased need for sleep  when hypomania escalates into mania, symptoms include:  -incomprehensibly fast thoughts/speech -dangerously impulsive behavior -possible psychosis  contrary to popular belief, most people with bipolar disorder are not constantly fluctuating between extremes. they may experience normal moods for extended periods of time, and a single mood episode tends to last for a few weeks, though mania can quickly become depression and vice versa.  another common misconception is that bipolar disorder is like depression, but with the bonus of hypomania. depressive symptoms are equally severe in bipolar i and ii disorders, but for people with bipolar i disorder, mania is at least as dangerous and frightening as depression.  even for those people who experience relatively harmless highs, depression tends to immediately follow hypomania. whereas major depression can be treated with therapy (as well as medication) and possibly never recur, there is no cure for bipolar disorder and therapy is of limited use. bipolar disorder has a strong genetic basis and is usually found in families.  people with bipolar disorder are often stereotyped as screw-ups, drug addicts, etc. there is a strong link between bipolar disorder and substance abuse, but many people either recover from or avoid these problems altogether and lead relatively normal, responsible lives.  your girlfriend when she is mad at you = not bipolar  anyone bitchy or randomly moody = probably not bipolar ","the rilo kiley song ""a better son/daughter"" is often thought to be about [*SLANGAAAP*] disorder:  and sometimes when you're on, you're really fucking on and your friends, they sing along and they love you but the lows are so extreme that the good seems fucking cheap and it teases you for weeks in its absence"

cutter,"i'm totally shocked by the number of people who find it neccessary to critisize and make fun of cutters.  cutting is a seriuos issue and is no more worty of being made fun of than any other illnesses (down syndrome, diabetes, mental retardation).  cutting is often a sign of bigger issues that need immediate attention, such as depression, anxiety, dissociative disorders, ect.  the strange thing about human psychology is that there are no set rules. everyone is different and expresses themselves in their own way.  you don't have to have the worste past in the world to be depressed.  depression is a chemical disorder in your brain that can be passed down geneticly.  just because your parents are rich or not divorced doesn't mean that you cannot have depression.  in my experiances depression is triggered by life events that overwhelm the affected person.  a death in the family may not bother some as much as it does others.  there is no chart to say how sad you should be for each of lifes events, and no way of avoiding your genetic past.  also, the sterotype of mostly girls commiting si is obsurd.  males are just as likely to si as females. maybe they dont seek help like females or do it in different ways (punching walls, knowingly doing dangerous things, ect.).  athough i will admit that in the large numbers of people in the world it has to be true that some peope cut just for attention.  these people can usually be uncovered by listening to them talk.  most cutters tell only the people closest to them (spouse, close friend ect.).  attention seekers would have to let almost everyone they know about thier actions in order to recieve the attention desired.  althought i'm sure there are people who are just tired of hiding thier actions, and decide that they don't care who finds out and judges them, but that doesn't mean they will advertise their affliction.  it would become increasing difficult to hide the longer you cut since you will eventually run out of space on your commonly covered skin.

aspartame,"(or e951) is a sugar substitute, also classified as an ""excitotoxin"", found mainly in tea sweeteners such as equal/nutrasweet, diet drinks and sugar free products. aspartame consists of 50% aspartic acid, 40% phenylalanine and 10% methanol.  aspartame is known to be a very dangerous substance as many people have been complaining of over 92 different health side-effects after consuming it. short term side-effects include headaches/migraines, dizziness, difficulty thinking and nausea, whereas long-term consuption of it has been known to cause diseases such as fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, blindness and brain tumours.  during digestion, the methanol breaks down into formaldehyde and formic acid which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. these two substances have the potential to break down the blood-brain barrier and destroy neurons and brain cells. aspartic acid and phenylalanine are actually utilized by our bodies in small doses, but in high amounts, they are neurotoxic.","diet coke drinker: ""here, u shud try sum of this, its shugger free!"" 8^d  aware individual: ""oh god no thanks, that contains [*SLANGAAAP*], i'd keep well clear of that if i were you!""  diet coke drinker: ""lol, wots tha?"" :s"

crack,"as a rule of thumb, it is profoundly unwise to take crack-cocaine. the brain has evolved a truly vicious set of negative feedback mechanisms. their functional effect is to stop us from being truly happy for long. nature is cruelly parsimonious with pleasure. the initial short-lived euphoria of a reinforcer as powerful as crack will be followed by a ""crash"". this involves anxiety, depression, irritability, extreme fatigue and possibly paranoia. physical health may deteriorate. an intense craving for more cocaine develops. in heavy users, stereotyped compulsive and repetitive patterns of behaviour may occur. so may tactile hallucinations of insects crawling underneath the skin (""formication""). severe depressive conditions may follow; agitated delirium; and also a syndrome sometimes known as toxic paranoid psychosis. the neural aftereffects of chronic cocaine use include changes in monoamine metabolites and uptake transporters. there is down-regulation of dopamine d2 receptors to compensate for their drug-induced overstimulation. thus the brain's capacity to experience pleasure is diminished.","he was a normal guy until he started smoking [*SLANGAAAP*], now he is a [hustler] that sucks dick for $5 to buy another rock.

infatuated,"the disgustingly happy feeling that is quite similar to a head injury. when infatuated, all common sense fails you. you turn into a giddy, giggling, goofily happy version of yourself that raises the eyebrows of the people that generally know you as a calm, smart, down to earth individual. you lose all sense of time while you're with the object of infatuation. you sit and grin while sitting in traffic remembering all sorts of little details of the times you've spent together. sometimes, you laugh out loud and strangers look at you in fear and amusement. your priorities suddenly change, everything that was important is no longer so. you forget or blatantly ditch out on events that don't involve your infatuation. you smile like a fool when their name shows up on your phone, you become a flustered moron when you're with them and yet you love it. you can't shut up to save your life, rambling the weirdest stories you've ever heard coming out of your mouth. seeing them makes your whole week worthwhile. dating, staying overnight, and waking up with them feels so amazing you question your sanity. you fall asleep and wake up thinking of the infatuation. you listen to terrible songs that remind you of them and check the urban dictionary to ensure your condition is normal. it's a wonderfully horrible change of character that should be welcomed but kept on a leash, lest someone have you committed.","is she walking around smiling to herself, singing, skipping and forgetting all our plans because of the brain injury she received in the car accident?

boa,"a pretty korean singer whom although she does not bear any credit to writing her own lyrics, has achieved things in her nineteen years that most people will never achieve. the girl fluently speaks three other languages beside her native tongue of korean; japanese, mandarin and english. boa is so popular in asia, that she has two seperate official websites. one based in korea and one based in japan. she also has a bunch of unofficial english websites created by her fans in america and europe. once of boa's recent japanese single releases, 'do the motion' was so popular that it surpassed 200,000 copies, taking the top spot on the weekly oricon chart, and made boa the first non-japanese asian to reach number one in over a decade. her album sales have also broken official figures for biggest seller. boa's first album released in japan has recorded an order quantity of 1.2 million copies as did her recent greatest hits 'best of soul'. she is a star renoun throughout the whole of asia and totally owns the stage next to most other asian pop singers.  she has also opened the door to other korean singers to come across to the japanese market, eg;[se7en], dbsk. her popularity in japan has also been seen as a positive aid in rebuilding past broken ties between the two nations.  her dancing is unmatched and she can actually hold a note without the aid of voice sythesisers. amazingly she performs live whilst conducting complicated dance routines; even for crummy tv appearances.  boa has also done tons of modellling including a shoot for maybelline in new york.  despite the fact that boa is only fully exposed to the east asian market, she is still often compared to britney spears for her overnight dominance and similar 'pop princess' countenance. this is questionable however as boa is not half as slutty. that is just the tip of why boa is not britney spears but i'm sure you can form your own opinion on that seperate matter.","as of writing, [*SLANGAAAP*] currently has 5 korean albums, as well as 3 mini albums. she also has 15 japanese singles and 3 albums including a greatest hits. this is not to mention her various collaberation projects with other artists."

fugitive,"a game created in saratoga, ca that traditionally takes place in the golden triangle but can be applied to any suburban area. fugitive involves anywhere from 10-25 high school kids, usually upperclassmen. the point of the game is to run from one central place (such as a school) to another central place (such as a local store) while other players chase the runners in cars. the rules are simple, no taking major roads, no cheating, runners get a several minute head start, and you must make it to your final destination in under 45 minutes. fugitive games always take place at nighttime or anytime when it’s dark. jumping into random yards, hiding in bushes, and trying to camouflage in shadows are the norm. the runners usually win as it only takes one runner to constitute a victory for the runners. the drivers typically have another person riding with them in the car. their job is to jump out and tag the runner or call out his/her name if they are clearly identifiable. once a runner is tagged or called out, they join the driver and ride in the car until the end of the game. unfortunately, many fugitive games end up being cut short by the arrival of the cops as some residents see the kids and mistake them for burglars or shady people trying to rob them. if the cops come, they usually come in force, three to four squad cars is not uncommon. sometimes they'll let you go, other times they'll take names down.","guy: hey, do you want to play [*SLANGAAAP*]? i've got about 15 people going already. girl: yeah sure, that sounds like fun.  cop: what the hell are you kids doing? curfew is 11:00. guy 1: sorry officer, we were playing a game. cop: well that's not what it looked like, we already sent a chopper up to scan the area from moffet field. guy 2: bullshit."

rap,"contrary to most of the shit posted here, i have supplied the [actual] definition: rapping is one of the elements of hip hop as well as the distinguishing feature of most hip hop music. it is a form of rhyming lyrics delivered rhythmically over a musical backdrop of sampling, scratching and mixing by djs. originally, rapping was called mcing and accompanied djing.  [origins] rapping (as a self-conscious artistic school) began as a variation on the toasting found in reggae, funk and dub music, mixed with influences from jazz-related performance poetry (langston hughes's album weary blues being an important example; the beats also notable), radio dj patter, and the tradition of playing the dozens. among other predecessors were talking blues records and the work of artists such as james brown and parliament. the original rappers probably can be said to have been the last poets and gil scott-heron with their recordings in the latter 1960s and earliest 1970s (such as scott-heron's famous ""the revolution will not be televised"" and ""whitey on the moon""), but, slightly later, mcs (from ""master of ceremonies"") would improvise rhymes over the beats created by dancehall and club djs. early raps were frequently merely a sequence of boasts, or attempts to upstage the other mcs. see roots of hip hop music for earlier forms that also contributed to rapping.  the first contemporary hip hop song released on a major label was 1979's ""king tim iii (personality jock)"" by the fatback band (featuring the rapper king tim iii). the sugarhill gang followed the same year with ""rapper's delight"" (based on chic's ""good times"") which became a major hit and opened the floodgates for the nascent genre. in 1980, blondie became one of the first acts to feature a rap sequence in a pop song, resulting in the #1 hit ""rapture.""  [descendents and influence] rapping is one of the four elements of hip hop: mcing (rapping), djing (mixing, cutting and scratching), graffiti (tagging), and breakdancing. however, in the course of rap's history, new musical styles developed that use rapping - especially rapcore, also known as rap/rock or rap/metal, first introduced by crossover pioneer run-dmc's collaboration with aerosmith in 1986. some alternative rap has musically very little to do with mainstream hip hop music. often consisting of bizarre soundscapes and vivid lyrics, abstract hip-hop has developed, largely in the underground.  music outside of the united states has taken the rap style and blended it with completely different elements. japanese dance music, for example, often uses rapping to complement or break up the singing parts, with lyrics containing upbeat themes set to energetic rhythms and clean, warm synths. rap was instantly popular in the united kingdom, perhaps building on the great popularity of dub and reggae toasting. mcs also became a fixture at jungle and uk garage events, whilst a recent offshoot of garage, dubbed grime, has focused on rapping, making stars of rappers such as dizzee rascal and wiley.  [the importance of rhyme] undoubtedly, the most important element of rap lyrics is rhyme. in other forms of poetry, rhymes that span many syllables are often considered whimsical but in hip hop, the ability to construct raps with large sets of rhyming syllables is considered a sign of intelligence and achievement. for the same reason, rap music is sometimes referred to as ""street poetry"" or ""street rhyme"". to accomplish rhymes of this sophistication, rappers can use single rhyming words (intellectual/ineffectual) or they can use multiple words whose constituent syllables rhyme (octoroon/doctor dooom). rap lyrics often contain long series of lines each of which rhyme with each other. occasionally, entire songs are composed in this fashion where all lines rhyme with each other. of course, the more intricate the rhymes are, the more abstract the song becomes. this is because the more focus given to impressive rhyming, the harder it becomes to write coherently. battle raps can be written with complex rhyming techniques easier than raps that tell a story or convey a message because a battle rap can employ a vast array of metaphors to conjure images of rapper to rapper combat.  rhyme is also integral to freestyle battles. these contests pit two rappers together to lyrically insult and intimidate each other with impromptu lyrics. the ability to construct clever rhymes to insult the opponent ""off the top of the dome"" (dome being slang for head) is a critical skill to winning these contests.  [different types of rhymes] not all rhymes used in rap are clear cut. often, consonance, assonance, half rhymes, and internal rhyme schemes are employed. making a distant word with similar sounds at some points sound like a rhyme is sometimes considered a sign of a good rapper. an example of a rapper who makes heavy use of assonance is eminem.  [importance of various techniques] although rhyme is the essential required element of all raps, there are other literary techniques that are often employed. to use many of these techniques while still maintaining a meaningful rhyme is considered by most rap listeneres to be signs of a good rhyme.  [cadence] cadence is the overall balance of a rhyme in relation to the beat, as far as emphasis and speed (and in some cases, changes in melody). it is also known as ""riding the beat"". cadence plays an especially large role in the raps of west coast hip-hop. many hip-hop listeners find snoop dogg to be an example of a rapper with varying -- but always strong -- cadence in his raps. he is seen this way because of his ability to ride slow, fast, melodic, or hardcore beats equally well.  [prosody] unlike many other forms of poetry, rappers typically don't think about metre and feet very heavily. instead, the goal is to unconciously develop a flow. a good flow is a metre that doesn't drag along, but rather, draws the listener into the words. big boi of outkast is considered to have a good flow by many fans. it is important to note that rappers sometimes do use forms such as iambic pentameter.  [enunciation] speaking clearly is important because rap is said outloud unlike many other forms of poetry. enunciation in rap is sometimes exaggerated to a cartoonish level, which is actually a sign of skill. ludacris is considered an example of a good enunciator.  [style, voice, tone, attitude, and soul] these terms are essentially the emotions carried by the rapper in his music and lyrics.  [speed] to some, the speed of a rapper's words are an example of skill. a rapper who can rap quickly and coherently is considered skillful. however, rapping slowly doesn't necessarily mean a lack of skill, nor does rapping fast mean quality; some raps become incomprehensible when performed at a high tempo. an example of a fast rapper is twista, who is considered both fast and skillful in his rhymes.  [wordplay] wordplay include double entendres, alliteration, and all forms of playing around with your words. wordplay is subjective -- whether it's done well or poorly is up to the listener.  [other techniques] there are several other techniques used in rapping, such as: enjambment and hyperbole.  [the message] wordplay shows skill, but the message of a rap is more important. a rapper who talks about nothing with excellent wordplay doesn't show as much skill as one who has a message, because his or her creativity has no frame around it. the message can be about one's life, about politics, about philosophy, about bragging, and anything with meaning. it can tell a story or show imagery that occurs in the rappers everyday life. nonsense or dadaist rappers such as aesop rock are often looked down on by the purist hiphop fans for not having a real soulful message, and for ""watering down the sound of the ghetto"" (kool keith).  [traditional forms] in many traditional cultures there exist lyrical forms that could loosely be described as rapping. examples of these include:  mor lam in laos  chastushka in russia  tsiattista in cyprus  enka slamta in ethiopia  tassou in senegal  rhapsody in ancient greece  gstanzl in bavaria and similar traditions in austria and switzerland.  urdu rap from pakistan  kuai ban in china  ",[*SLANGAAAP*] is good stuff to listen to

avenge," here follows the definition of the words [avenge] and [revenge] + the difference between [avenge] and [revenge].   both words are about repaying a wrong. the differences between them have to do with grammar and shades of meaning, though there is considerable overlap in meaning, dictated by usage over time. grammatically speaking, [avenge] is a verb only; [revenge] is a verb and more usually a noun. [avenge] traditionally relates not only to repaying a wrong but to getting justice on somebody else's behalf as a remedy for that wrong. [revenge] traditionally relates to getting even with an adversary by inflicting punishment or harm.   though both [avenge]and [revenge] can be used as transitive verbs with reflexive pronouns, [revenge] is commoner in this use: the dictatorship [avenged] itself on the partisans' radio station by burning it to the ground; as a victim of a hate crime, she finally [avenged] herself on the perpetrators."," they vowed to [*SLANGAAAP*] their sister's murder (or their murdered sister).  in an act of revenge for the bombing of our ship, our navy shelled the terrorists' training camps; bands of irregular soldiers set out to revenge their leader's assassination.

gun,"gun. you know, barrel, trigger, bullet, bang bang you're dead. guns are the cat's best friend  well known fact: guns don't kill people, flaming shoulder pads kill people. often times with guns. unless the gun misfires, killing the shooter, in which case, yes, guns do kill people.  well, the gun helps.  this fact was tested scientifically by the royal society in 1701, and they discovered that in fact bullets kill people most of the time, and guns kill people if you smack them upside the head with them.  fuck, my head hurts. just shoot me now.  there are some cases also, in which you may have a friend called gun that does not like you very much. but that's part of life anyway... and son of a gun isn't very nice at times either.   the gun consists of three principal components: the barrel, the projectile and the propellant. the propellant is a rapidly expanding substance which forces the bullet down the barrel and towards the intended target. the shooter must be sure to never mess up (like firing the barrel by holding the propellant or by manually pushing the bullets through the barrel to push the propellant).  on leaving the barrel the bullet causes a supersonic shock wave to be emitted which propagates towards the victim, causing distraction. often, guns are fitted with noise-enhancing devices to increase this effect.  the modern firearm is equipped with a spark chamber, designed to produce muzzle flash. this is to allow guns to be used as ad-hoc flashlights in darkened areas by repeated firing. the flash also acts to scare and unnerve the victim. in fact, in the early days of photography before the invention of the flashbulb, photographs were illuminated by the discharge of a large cannon. this made the photographer amongst the deadliest of professions.  post-modern weaponry, consists of phasors which emit a powerful beam which is enough to cut a loaf of bread into slices suitable for eating by dwarf-humans, klingons and bacterium alike. the beam is often colorful, to prevent boredom in between in-ship battles, and to create some random distraction for the enemies to look at.   guns in entertainment  guns are used in many tv shows and movies. they are often used out of context, such as being a soother for a baby, rather than a deadly weapon.  guns are used in the tv show 24. this is a show about how jack bauer runs around killing people with guns.  ray guns are often used in the show star trek, in which the main characters shoot the bad characters. it is widely disputed as to whether their ray guns are accurate portrayal of real ray guns. it should be noted that guns are known to fire metal bullets rather than lasers.   why do people die from gun?  in soviet russia, people kill guns!! ~ charlton heston, nra spokesman  often the shock of a bright flash, loud ""bang"" and sharp metal projectile travelling at upwards of 300 metres per second can lead to psychological effects such as heart arrhythmia, fainting and farting. the most common effect is diarrhea. this is why, in a firefight, the stronger will prevails - weaker shooters (typically terrorists or imperial storm-troopers) will drop like flies from the stress of the experience and the weight of their full underwear, whereas those of a heroic disposition (such as americans and jedi) will withstand the nerve-rattling experience and survive.  a commonly held myth is that bullets penetrating the flesh will kill people. a simple back-of-envelope calculation reveals the flaw in this argument. by modelling bullets as point particles, and people as one-dimensional strings, one can see that the chance of a bullet hitting a person, even in a crowd of thousands, is infinitesimally small. the truth is that death from guns is often due to the sheer surprise of being shot at.  that said, being hit by a bullet is a common experience for the clinically obese, and the resulting pain and injury can often result in substantial fecal weight loss.  a study conducted by the university of scmiillicettittisinndamorghning in wales shows that people who get shot generaly die of some form of leadpoisoning. this awkward result has been classified by several gun toting rightwing trailertrash slobs as trival information, or so says the whitehouse ""if them folks are dumb enough to stand infront a speedin bullet. now ya hear"".   _______________________________________  guns are brilliant tools of illegal death. murder and suicide are the best examples. as one of the troops in an al-quaida training camp said shortly before shooting herself three times in the head with an ak47 from different angles and then putting the weapons tidily back into the armoury (that part is actually true): ""don't leave me, i've had death threats,"" which is obvious code for ""i am a zombie and will kill myself to please our lord jesus christ who died for all of our sins."" her suicide note which wasn't written in her handwriting, leads scientists to believe she used her zombie psychic powers to make someone else write it, who coincidentally didn't like her. this is likely inspired by the late jfk's suicide, which involved stabbing himself three times in the back, pissing on his own dead body and throwing himself off a bridge. this is indeed an accomplishment in suicide.  guns don't kill people. people don't kill people. the bullets and/or the shock of the blast or the person bleeding is what kills them. the gun is blamed because it helps and the person is responsible because they were just around when the person died.   other countries have varying laws for guns, gun crimes, and gun control.  guatemala: it is mandatory a gun is given to all babies of 5 months of age and up.  canada: canadians are too shy to operate guns. canada has no gun-related deaths.  japan: grenade launchers are constantly circulated througout this country by the mafia. dogs must be licensed to own a firearm.  australia: guns are banned in australia, so the government can feel safe that the population won't rise up against them. knives are preferable.  the united states: there are no guns in this country. most people will vomit at the sight of them.  new zealand: many native species are threatened with extinction, including but not limited to; kiwi, tuatara, moa, proud-mullet-wearing bogans, hobbits and 'real' men. this is the result of captain cook introducing firearms to the native sheep in 1770, at the same time introducing women, rambo-style headbands, and a hearty cocktail called ""the wilde captain"" made from seawater, chocolate icecream, and methylated spirits and named after a certain british author. sheep, usually docile, innocent, cuddly animals went abso-frikkin-lutely postal in a multi-cultural, genocidal, extravaganza, with much ""are you talkin' to me?"" and ""do you feel lucky, punk?""ing (sic). their lush white feathers were stained the blood of their foes for a millenia. all hail our glorious sheep overlords!  germany: children commit 97% of gun crimes. a banana can be purchased at any mom and pop adult video store.  zimbabwe: this highly industrialized nation has made the most advances in laser technology, and keeps guns closely guar","“careful with that axe, eugene...”      ~ oscar wilde on [*SLANGAAAP*](s)"

charlotte,"a rapidly growing city in the southern piedmont of north carolina.  nicknamed the ""queen city"" after queen charlotte of mecklenburg in 18th century prussia, charlotte has about two million residents living in and around the area, and is headquarters for major banks [wachovia] and [bank of america].  the [nascar hall of fame] is also set to be in charlotte.  [lowes motor speedway] is a trademark of the city, characterizing the city's heritage for stock car racing.  charlotte is also home to many [nascar] drivers.  charlotte is also home to the nfl's [carolina panthers], and the nba's [charlotte bobcats], both of which are fairly new organizations, resulting from the rapid growth of the city.  charlotte used to be home to the nba's [new orleans hornets], which left town after a dispute between ownership and the city over a new arena.  after the dispute, charlotte petitioned the nba for a new franchise, and built a multi-million dollar uptown arena for the new team.  the charlotte hornets were originally named for the city's fierce rebellion during the american revolution.  general cornwallis called charlotte a ""hornet's nest of rebellion"".  charlotte is quickly becoming another [atlanta], a system of poorly planned roads and randomly placed neighborhoods that result from a booming economy, also known as urban sprawl.  crime and corruption among the charlotte police plauge the city, another ill side-effect of a quickly growing city, although the wealthy areas of the city remain exempt from these problems.  schools in charlotte range from mediocre to just plain bad.  the overall educational system in charlotte is declining because the schools can't keep up with all the growth.  the exception is unc-charlotte, which has no affilation with the charlotte educational system, which is a decent place to go to college if you aren't in college for the social scene.  culture in charlotte is almost non-existant, with a few exceptions.  a stretch of road called north davidson (abbrevated noda among locals) is a plot of [asheville] in charlotte.  there are a few good places to see live music in charlotte, including [verizon wireless ampitheather], [tremont music hall], [the milestone], with a plethora of smaller venues directed more towards local talent. overall, charlotte is a nice city on the outside, but has problems on the inside.",i went to [*SLANGAAAP*] last weekend...there was a bank on every corner.

india,"india is a place where i happen to be born, it is my country, and my identity. wherever the world i go, i am an indian. and i want to clear some stereotypes about india  1) tigers do not roam in indian streets. in fact at the rate at which poaching is going on, you would be lucky to find a tiger in a forest.  2) india is not just a land of nawabs, maharajas and beggars. it also has a very strong, educated middle class, who are like the middle class in any other nation. most of these middle class people, work in govt offices, factories, software companies, mnc's, universities. i belong to that great indian middle class.  2) not all of india is a hot country. no other nation has such diversity in climate. the southern part of india is humid and hot, the northern part of india is hot and dry. the himalayan states of himachal pradesh and uttaranchal have a cold and temperate climate. the western states of gujarat and rajasthan, have a desert kind of climate.  3) probably one of the few countries where you can find the alps( himalayas), the sahara( thar desert), the congo(numerous forests) and the riveira( goa) all in one place. a place of natural diversity and beauty.  4) india has 26 languages, 320 dialects and no two states are alike. yet it has managed to be united still, unlike europe where countries keep splitting, and africa, which has become a collection of tribes rather than countries.  5) indian men are often portrayed as sex starved frustrated beasts, ready to pounce on women, and especially foreign woman. there have been deplorable cases of rape and assault for sure, but not every indian guy is a sex starved maniac. india is not more dangerous than s.africa or afghanistan when it comes to women.  6) indian women suffer from many problems sure, like female foeticide, rape, gender discrimination. but things are changing for the better. a considerable number of indian women go to work, run businesses, are ceo's of companies, drive buses and trains, fight in the army, fly planes, teach, nurse. in some cases they form cooperatives also. and there is a strong feminist movement in india still.  7) not all indians are curry eaters nor all indians are vegetarians. yes many indians do not eat beef, but thats only the hindu community. indian muslims and indian christians do eat beef. even in the hindu community, while many communities do not eat beef, they do consume other non veg items like poultry and meat. in the eastern states of west bengal and orissa, fish is a staple item of diet.  8) notwithstanding gujarat,2002 and the graham staines incident, india still remains a secular country. muslims have more rights in india, than in any other muslim majority nation. this is a country which has had 3 presidents from muslim community, where the missile and nuclear program was headed by a muslim, where a jew and a christian headed the defence forces. this is a nation where 3 muslim actors- aamir, shahrukh and salman are the top most heroes, and a muslim headed the indian cricket team. walk into any mnc in india, and you find muslims, christians, hindus working side by side. yes we do have our prejudices and biases, but show me one nation in the world which does not have it.  9) while india has the moral keystone cops indulging in moral policing, most of em are jerks seeking 15 minutes of fame. they are certainly not like the taliban, which simply executes people who do not believe in it's warped sense of the world.  10) to date india has never invaded any country, but it has always given a fitting reply to any nation that tried to attack it. the indian army has been rated as one of the world's most disciplined army, and even in war torn areas like iraq, bosnia, somalia, the indian army always earned respect. because they built bridges with the local people.  11) not all indian movies are song and dance affairs. there are directors like anurag kashyap, vishaal bharadwaj, nagesh kukunoor, madhur bhandarkar, maniratnam, ram gopal verma who are equivalent to the best anywhere in the world.  india is not the world's most perfect country. we have our own issues and they are many. but we certainly are not an exotic nation of tigers, elephants and maharajas. we are a nation that is trying to achieve a balance between tradition and modernity, between order and chaos, between the old and new. and on top of it, we have to deal with caste, class, language and regional differences.  i request all people in the west to look at india as not just an exotica place, but a country filled with living people. we are just like you, we also have the same dreams and desires like you, we also suffer from same problems. as an indian, i only want to ask one thing, please dont look at our country as exotica, we are asking you to understand our problems and our issues. ","[*SLANGAAAP*] is my country, and i love it."

bong,"a bong is a smoking device whose origins lie somewhere in or around vietnam.  a standard bong generally consists of a glass tube with the stem, and a removable bowl (though there are pieces with carburators and fixed bowls).  the body is filled with water until the stem is submerged about one inch (less for smaller bongs), the bowl is inserted into the stem (with smoking material), and the smoking material is introduced to an open flame as the user lowers the air pressure in the chamber by sucking, causing smoke to be drawn through the water and filtered (a precooler may be inserted in the stem for better filtration).  the user then, while sucking, removes the bowl and sucks, causing the smoke to be forced into the lungs.  bongs offer health benefits as bong water tends to remove a number of carcinogens, lowering the smoker's chances of contracting illnesses such as lung cancer.  for marijuana users, the bong offers a better high than most other methods (except for oral administration), as the smoke is less harsh, and quite cool (even more so when mixed with ice), enabling the inhalation of more smoke.  with marijuana use, bong water can be saved, and after being stored for a period of time, a slimy resin can be collected from the bottom of the container and smoked.  however, drinking of bong water is not advised, as it contains negligible amounts of thc and higher levels of carcinogenic material",don't drink the [*SLANGAAAP*] water

communism,"communism, though recently associated with corrupt totalitarian states such as [china] and the [soviet union] is one of the natural states of human existance, the idea of living in a self-sustaining group that cares for its members, like they did in the [paleolithic] (old stone age), which is increasingly hard in the modern world. most families live in a sort of communism, as parents usually don't make the kids work for what they eat.  many societies, such as the [shakers] in [america], the [incas] in [peru], the [essines] in [israel], and many [early christian] groups, have practiced forms of communism. but communism with [das kapital] c didn't come about until the mid [1800s] when karl [marx] wrote the [communist manifesto], which stated that society was always going through transitions (the last two being [feudalism], and [capitalism]), and that now was the time for a transition into a [socialist] economy, which would lead to a classless society, which he called ""communism"". marx recognised the effectiveness of capitalism, but saw that it was only another step in this chain.  one of the most contraversial points about [modern communism] is that it is vocally [athiest], as marx had said ""[religion] is the [opium] of the people."" this is because marx's father was forced to convert from [judaism] to [christianity] in order to get a job in a largely [anti-semitic] country. because of this, the young marx decided that religion was fleeting, and was a tool of the opressor to bind the people. despite this, many religious-based communistic societies have existed.  in the early 1900s, in [russia], long after marx's death, the [tsar] [alexander ii] had declared war on [japan]. russia, after a devistating defeat in the [russo-japanese war], and heavy losses in [world war i], the people were ready for a new government. many looked to [marxism]. these  were lead by intellectuals such as vladamir ulyanov ""[lenin]"", and leon [trotsky]. they called themselves the [bolsheviks], and pelieved that the [proletariat], the workers, must triumph in an armed [revolution]. in 1917, the tsar was deposed, and followed by a capitalistic [provisional government]. this didn't cut it for the [bolsheviks], and the bolsheviks soon gained control of russia. at first, the new [soviet union] seemed like a genuine [marxist] state, but soon an upstart named josef ""[stalin]"" ""the man of steel"", began his deadly regime, which effectively ended the idea of a just communist state.  the same thing was played out all over the world in places like [china], and [cuba]. corrupt dictators hijacked communistic ideals and used them for their own personal good.  so thus the great notions of communism will forever be tainted by the terror of corrupt dictators.","[*SLANGAAAP*]: as long as people will strive to rule over others, there will be no true communist state. -me"

nitrous,"1. the official iupac name for nitrous oxide, n2o, is dinitrogen oxide.  like many substances, n2o has a common name, ‘nitrous oxide’ which is so widely used that most people refer to the gas by its common name.  the gas was discovered by joseph priestley.  2. the gas used by most dentists as an anaestetic. the mixture of n2o to oxygen is often about 50/50 (o / n2o), you need atleast 20/80 (o / n2o) in order to remain concious. this is not a concern when inhaling for recreation using a whipper.  3. an substance that when used properly, will cause a deeply satisfying  detachment from the physical world and person. an interesting thing about n2o is that it does not harm your body in anyway aside from gradual b12 deficiency, which can be combated with a over the counter b12 supplemnent every week, making this probably the safest intoxicat-or available. the best way for inhaling nitrous is through the use of a half-pint whipper from isi off amazon.  you may also obtain canisters, also known as 'whippets' from amazon. isi brand whippets are the best, liss being the second. if amazon is out of the question you can also pick it up at the local market or restaurant supply store, just make sure you do not ask for 'nitrous,' ask for n2o chargers-- clerks get uppity sometimes when you ask for it by its common name. one canister will cause about the same effects as at the dentist. atleast two straight whippets generally must be used to send you into a dreamstate. in said dreamstate time will pass incrediably fast, with detached logic and thought. when you come down from the high it will be realised that only 5 minutes have infact passed. three canisters are enough to cause you too pass out for roughly a minute, this is almost always filled with very amusing and interesting dreams.  *important* if inhaling nitrous for recreation it is very important not to do these, people have died from these obviously illogical things:  1. try to inhale n20 directly from whippits, or point escaping gas at anyone. the gas will give you frost burn.  2. strap a gas mask to your face. if you pass out, you want your body to get oxygen.  3. lock yourself in a room, closet, car, or refrigerator with a tank of nitrous and open it.  4. stand up and do it. stay away from open windows.  5. use a large tank without a regulator or which isn't strapped down.  6. use homemade nitrous. unless you are a chemist, you're likely to get a load of rubbish like no2, h2no3, and other yummy toxic things.  7. allow yourself to lose sight of moderation. no one likes a nitrous whore.","dude1: ""hey man, lets go get some x!"" dude2: ""no way, hard drugs are stupid, lets go get some [*SLANGAAAP*] and phuk ourselves up"""

","john the [*SLANGAAAP*] finds that he honestly does want to quit drinking but finds he cannot quit entirely, or if when drinking, he has little control over the amount he takes. he passes through the well-known stages of a spree, emerging remorseful, with a firm resolution not to drink again. this is repeated over and over, and unless this person can experience an entire psychic change there is very little hope of his recovery.
