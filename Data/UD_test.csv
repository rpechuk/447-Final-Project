mancunian,"uk: a person from manchester.  manchester is a city in the north of england. originally a roman settlement the romans wisely decided to leave it were it was and for hundreds of years it stayed dormant until it erupted like a festering boil during the industrial revolution.  the mancunian women live on council estates and give birth to between 4-12 young during a lifetime of 40-50 years when they die off from obecity, excessive smoking and atmospheric pollution. the young are allowed to run free as soon as they learn to walk at an age of 2-3 weeks and spend most of their time stealing, vandalising and spray painting and generally breaking everything in sight.  despite the occasional temporary appearance of a mancunian male in these nests, the young are often violent unpredictable creatures and a cattle prod is needed for proper guidance. on trying to get a female to control its offspring she makes the usual cry off 'eeesgotnoooowaretooogoww!’ and will attempt repeatedly to cross a pair of underdeveloped stubby little arms over her massive pair of overused jugs.  suggesting perhaps occasionally sending him/her into school for the day elicits a similar response. the governments efforts to build schools, colleges, libraries, leisure centres, parks, community centres, crèches in the area and having the biggest football ground in the country still do not help the situation as the females never move far from their daytime soapy television sets to learn of these things.  if the young see such a structure they naturally assume it has been put there for spray painting and have little more to do with it once it is completely coated in brightly colored paint exept perhaps to scent mark it by defecating or urinating on it. the females when not watching daytime soaps enjoy going to shopping centres and walking into people, this pastime is often enhaced by the use of shopping trollies or specially sharpened prams. sometimes they may take a break from this to go shoplifting or feed the numerous little ones at a ‘mc’donalds’.  the mancunian male lives on [lager vouchers] and spend their day grouped together in a watering hole called ‘the pub’ drinking boddingtons a yellow liquid that may be  the cause of a nervous affliction called the bodingtons twitch if drunk in sufficient quantities.  for sport they wait for strangers to enter the pub and play a game called ‘northern hospitality’  stage one involves getting the stranger to answer a lot of questions and buy them all bodingtons in vast quantities. stage two: involves turning the back on the person and completely ignoring them except for chattering on like women do in the rest of the country and referring occaisionally to the now financially challenged stranger in the third person. this behaviour is common in most pubs in manchester and quite well documented. the game is judged lost if the stranger manages to leave the pub with any money. about 11.00pm they then go of to reproduce or sleep over at ‘mams’, failing that they will happily curl up in a ditch or under a sofa on a nest of empty beer cans, cider bottles, old newspaper and carrier bags till the pubs open again.  fortunately manchester is easy to spot from a distance as it lies in a bowl shape depression and from a distance the shimmering yellow layer of smog and smoke that builds up in this bowl due to gravity makes it easy to see and avoid.  mancunians worship ‘manchester united’ and on feast day the city comes to a halt for ceremonial fighting, prayer and ritual use of boddingtons beer.  dress: track suits and stuff from thrift shops. they also tend to try and copy american fashion trends but do this very badly.  music: anything that they can buy in 4:4 time with no melody.  from a six year study based in stretford, manchester uk.","look a [*SLANGAAAP*], lets get the hell out of here quick."

bisexuality,the gift of nature to love both genders indiscriminately,"due to [*SLANGAAAP*], sarah has fallen in love with john and heather, wishing she could cuddle and make love with them both forever."
bisexuality,"technically, it's real, but i believe 50/50 bisexuality thing doesn't exist. you have to lean on one gender the most and if you do you're either a hetero or a homo, not ""bisexual"".  you're either straight with bi tendencies or gay with bi tendencies. that is the so-called ""bisexuality"", just a slight leaning. if you're not bisexual, you're 100% gay/straight. if you're ""bisexual"" you're only 90% gay/straight, and you should be called that, not bi.  these ""bisexual"" women who live with men prefer males and they'd only want sex with women for fun or for a guy's sake. i don't think they'd get fulfilled being with a woman. not to mention, some ""bisexual"" women do it for the attention - it's a trend these days and it's seen as hot by society.  straight men who have bi leanings are on the straight side and they get fulfilled with the women, so they wouldn't need men, even though they might have slight attraction. also, since society isn't approval on man-on-man sex, men (who are straight with bi leaning) wouldn't bother admitting they have slight attractions towards other men. so, thus, they will be called straight. and that's a rather correct term.  that is why bisexuality in men doesn't exist, but in women it seems scattered. women call themselves by very easily, even when having a slightly itty bitty attraction. if homosexuality was more accepted these days and if men weren't so homophobic, even they would be calling themselves bisexual.","chick: omg i saw this hot girl, i really felt like touching her boobs and i think it might feel good. i'm bi...hooray! heheehe  dude: hon shut up and stop being an attention seeker, you're straight! ________________________________________________  gay guy: i had it with this chick yesterday, she was hot and i sort of liked it. i guess i'm bisexual. but i didn't really...feel...huh...i dunno...i wasn't...uh...um  straight guy: dude, you're gay! you didn't feel anything you mean. you're gay! just because you banged a girl doesn't mean you're bisexual. ________________________________________________  straight guy: i walked and i saw this handsome man. i accidentally touched his bottom, i did feel tingly.  guy who thinks everything is gay: bro, you're gay. ew...come out...you're so gay! omg!  straight guy: i'm straight as they come you douche, but we humans are sexual beings, we will feel something. that's why so many men get raped in prison because there is [*SLANGAAAP*] among us but that doesn't mean we're fucking bisexuals. we're sexual creatures!  guy who thinks everything is gay: you're bisexual then!  straight guy: no i'm straight. i have to be fully fulfilled with a man, but i know i won't be. that's why i'm straight."

dyslexia,"dyslexia is way more then just letters, words and numbers; and you can never get rid of it, it says with you the rest of you life.  i'm [dyslexic], have been for my my whole life; i have to admit is sucks ass but it some times has it benefits.  i get extra time on tests and get to use tools to help me with homework.  now i know some of u use the dyslexia or dyslexic it describe someone stupid; ""now imagine your in english class, the teacher asks you to read out loud to the class.  you start to read but then panic because you do not knew how to say the next word or the word after that.  the class is looking at you as you try to figure out the word; someone finally says the word out loud but what about the other words. . ."" the is what dyslexics go through everyday of there life because reading is such am important part of our daily lives, and if you can't read very well life starts to get even harder.  then signs on the road on the freeway become difficult; signing papers reading business letters becomes hard.  then along come the people that might be like you; they mock the the ones that can't read, call them stupid.  then you say ""oh that's so dyslexic,"" saying to them that the disorder they have makes them stupid.  you may it not that important but to them it is very important, they lose self esteem; i remember back in grade school i never wanted to go to school because the kids would laugh at me.  it all hurt so much to me.  so the next time you get ready to say ""that was so dyslexic,"" think about that many people you may be hurting and put yourself in their shoes.  because a dyslexic's life is already difficult without you making fun of them. :)","i am dyslexic.  there are times when i hate [*SLANGAAAP*], there are times when i love it; but it is a part of me, so i just have to deal with it.  so i just think to myself that i have my dyslexic, it doesn't have me.  i think of it as a gift god gave it to me to share with it world.  and i am, one person at a time.

luger,"the p.08 luger is the pistol used by germany through both world wars as well as by many other countries including the swiss. the luger was originally chamered in 7.65 luger, which was a shortened 7.63 mauser cartridge. the first model luger was invented in 1898 by georg luger, and it was highly based off of the borchard pistol, but was a much more compact, and useful design.  they were originally just called the p.08, but they are known as lugers after their inventer's name.  the model we know today most popularly, is the model p.08 luger, introduced in 1908 as the standard sidearm of the german military. it deviated from previous lugers by eliminating the grip safety and being chambered in 9mm parabellum, which is the 7.65 luger casing redesigned to fit a 9mm projectile as requested by the [wehrmacht](german army.)  as a testament to the cartridge designed for it, the 9mm is still used by the u.s. military currently in the [m9], and is the [nato] standard pistol cartridge.  there were many manufacturers of lugers, some of the most popular being [mauser], dwm, kreighoff, erfurt, spandau, simpson & co. as well as foreign manufacturers such as vickers in england, and waffenfabrick bern of switzerland and some others. the german army used a 4"" barrel version, which is most popular, while the navy's version had a 6"" barrel. artillery crews had 10"" barrels. lugers have an 8 round capacity, however drum magazines made for the artillery lugers hold many more rounds.  lugers were known to be extremely accurate, even by todays standards, due to the fixed barrel design. they operate off of the maxim toggle action that the first machineguns used. lugers were made to extremely high tolerances, and fit together with immense precision. in 1938, the german military was mainly producing the walther p38 because it was a far cheaper design due to the lack of required hand fitting. lugers were produced until the end of world war ii however. lugers are the first practical semi-auto pistols to be made, and were extremely influential in the world of handguns. lugers with all matching parts and in good condition with original finish can be worth a lot of money today. they are also fabulously beautiful pistols and pieces of history and art, well sought after by collectors.",the german officer fended off the communists with his [*SLANGAAAP*].
