The attached IPython notebook contains the supplementary code for 'Semantically Informed Slang Interpretation'. Since we cannot publically release all revelant datasets used in the study due to copyright terms, the purpose of this code package is to provide an illustration of how the main results from the paper can be reproduced. Specifically, the code package includes all required non-standard code dependencies and code in the IPython notebook show how results can be reproduced using these libraries.

We include custom versions of code released from previous work in the following directories:

- **/CatGO** - A categorization library from Zhewei Sun, Richard Zemel, and Yang Xu, 'Slang generation as categorization', 2019.
- **/ilm** - A pre-trained GPT-2 based language infill model from Chris Donahue, Mina Lee, and Percy Liang, 'Enabling language models to fill in the blanks', 2020
- **/slanggen** - A library for training contrastively learned slang sense embeddings from Zhewei Sun, Richard Zemel, and Yang Xu, 'A computational framework for slang generation', 2021.
